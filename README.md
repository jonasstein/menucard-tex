a4 3 fold menu card in LaTeX


The Troisdorfer Linux User Group used a menu flyer from a nice Vietnamese restaurant which had many typos and typographical mistakes.
Several order numbers were used for two or more meals and made our group ordering a bit complicate.
Finally everybody got what she or he liked and it tested well. So we decided to create a new flyer in LaTeX.

We hope it is ready to use before our next mass order. ;-)
